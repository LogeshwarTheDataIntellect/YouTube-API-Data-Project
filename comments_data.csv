I first select the values from the sql database then by the Id of that row, I select the mongodb doc's data. This way I reduce the select query load time significantly because when the sql memory size is kept small, it's much easier to select the id and then instantly find the document you're looking for from the mongodb. Also one more keynote to take here is that It's always good to make sure you overclock the memory and manually adjust the memory timings. For example if your tRFC timing is ridiculously high by default, drop it to something like 400-500, also If your tREFI timing is low like 9000, increase it to like 32000 or even more if you're not on an hedt platform.
